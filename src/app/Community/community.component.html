            For many years, if you are from southeast asia, you've been playing league with the use of garena. But with
            these changes, we can expect many great things like connection issues and stuffs. We can now also play games
            that can be found on riot client you previously played on your riot account, now with a new game linked to

            Since ver. 3, farming for handguards has always been hard due to its low drop rate. With this farming route,
            you can now easily upgrade your character and weapon more easily now.

            The way they created the smoke physics in CS2 is actually impressive like how reactive it is on explosions
            and bullet shots. I wonder how much this will change on how does the game is usually played.
